## ABOUT ME
I am a creative and resourceful software developer with a background in web development and creative industries. I have experience in Python, JavaScript, Swift and agile scrum project management, alongside many other commonly used technologies. Building on a previous solid foundational knowledge of web development and project management skills gained from previous roles, I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency and strong communication skills to the table. I am excited to bring these skills to a Software Developer role as I complete my move into tech.

## EDUCATION & OTHER
Education
Leiden University, Netherlands - MA, Linguistics
UCL, UK - BA, Classics and Classical Languages

### Other
My interest in languages, which informed my university education choices, also led to the writing of my own children’s book which was published in 2020. Literally: Amazing Words and Where They Come From received glowing reviews from multiple publications and was supported with a marketing campaign including an interview on the Just Imagine podcast. This gave me a chance to talk at length about my love of languages, and first hand experience of being a creative involved in a marketing campaign.

I also enjoy video game and modding them, and have recently gained some experience working in a Windows developer workflow with Chocolatey and Oh My Powershell while developing a mod to complement my MacOS developer experience through Makers Academy.
