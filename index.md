## 🧠 EDUCATION & OTHER

### Education

Leiden University, Netherlands - MA, Linguistics

UCL, UK - BA, Classics and Classical Languages

### Other

My interest in languages, which informed my university education choices, also led to the writing of my own children’s book which was published in 2020. <a href="https://justimagine.co.uk/podcast/patrick-skipworth/">Literally: Amazing Words and Where They Come From</a> received glowing reviews from multiple publications and was supported with a marketing campaign including an interview on the Just Imagine podcast. This gave me a chance to talk at length about my love of languages, and first hand experience of being a creative involved in a marketing campaign.

I also enjoy video game and modding them, and have recently gained some experience working in a Windows developer workflow with Chocolatey and Oh My Powershell while developing a mod to complement my MacOS developer experience through Makers Academy.
